# Problems with Literate Program

* Focus on publishing
* Treats documentation as source of truth
* Doesn't integrate with existing programs
* tangling can leave artifacts in code
* poor integration with editors for syntax highlighting

# How to address

* Syntax aware tangling
** comment artifact tangling as backup
* user editing virtual file
* treat code as master
* use mostly standard markdown
